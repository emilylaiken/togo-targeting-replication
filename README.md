# Togo Targeting Replication Code

## Introduction
This repository contains replication code for the paper "Machine Learning and Mobile Phone Data Can Improve Targeting of Humanitarian Assistance" by Emily Aiken, Suzanne Bellue, Dean Karlan, Chris Udry, and Joshua Blumenstock. This readme provides information about the code structure, including where replication code for each figure and table in the paper is located, and information about the data available.

## Code Structure
All code is written in Jupyter Notebooks, in Python version 3.6. Replication code for all figures and tables that are generated with code is provided. It is assumed that the reader already has access to featurized mobile phone data matched to survey observations (as shown in the synthetic data provided, see section on "data structure" for more information). The scripts are organized into five notebooks as follow:
